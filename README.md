# Website for the Pune Ruby User Group

### What is this website all about?

Punerb.org is a reflection of the Ruby user community in Pune.

It is a place where we share relevant knowledge and propagate Ruby skill.

### The first rule about PuneRUG.. Nah just kidding. Find us here:

Website - `punerb.org`
IRC - `#punerb` on freenode
Mailing List - `https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/puneruby`

### So, you have and idea (or you found a bug)?!

To share an idea (or report a bug), just use github issues:

* Go to [Step by step instructions here..]
* `New issue`
* Tag issue
* Submit

### Ah, you want to contribute..

To add a new feature, it is recommended that you follow this procedure:

* Assuming you're starting from a git-committed state. If not, commit or stash your code just before you start on the feature.
* Create and checkout to a branch appropriately named, for example `git checkout -b super_sexy_feature`.
* Code, commit and push to that branch. You can use `git push origin super_sax_feature` to keep things in sync with GitHub online.
* Once you are happy with the feature, submit a Pull Request.

**Why bother?:** This process helps keep the demons out of the code. Get with it!

**If it's a very minor edit:** then you can make those changes in your Master branch itself, and send a Pull Request.
